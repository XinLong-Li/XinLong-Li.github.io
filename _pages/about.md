Hi, Welcome to my homepage.

My name is Xinlong Li. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree at ShanghaiTech University, and my research interests are quadrotor control and embedded systems.

Before that, I worked as a hardware development engineer at Siglent Technologies CO., Ltd, Shenzhen, China. I was mainly responsible for the hardware upgrade and maintenance of a 1GHz bandwidth oscilloscope (SDS5000X).

I received my bachelor's degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrument from Guilin University of Electronic Technology.
